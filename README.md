# Homework-3
this was a fun assignment thankfully all the css and html was already written making it an easier task to just focus on getting the site to operate correctly 
im much more of a hands on learner so having to type out the function of a-z in both upper and lowercase was very solidifying. 
learning how to use the prompt was pretty cool too
